LEETCODE PROBLEM: Check If N and its double exist

You are given an array of Ints and are asked to check if there exist two integers N and M such that N is the double of M...(N == 2* M)

i != j

0 <= i, j < arr.length

arr[i] == 2 * arr[j]


**************SAMPLE CASES***************


INPUT: [10,2,5,3]

OUTPUT: true

Explanation: N is equal to 10 and we can see that 2 * 5 = 10 so there for the output is true



INPUT: [3,4,9,10]

OUTPUT: false

Explanation: With this input there is no N that equals 2 * M
